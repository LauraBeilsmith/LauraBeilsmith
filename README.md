- I am an epidemiologist interested in the intersection of public health and climate change with a passion for developing holistically healthy communities. 
    I hope to supplement the big data approach of epidemiology with individual empowerment, education, communication, and understanding. 
    In my career in public health I hope to use the knowledge and skills I have gained as well as my advocacy experience to ensure there is a fundamental
    understanding of the need for intersectional and interdisciplinary work in health care and the need for community engagement and support in order to develop
    healthy communities.
